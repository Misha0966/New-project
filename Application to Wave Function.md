# Wave Function and Quantum States

The SNS algorithm works like a **collapse of the wave function**:

During multiplication and recombination of parts,

the **beginning and end** are preserved — like **probabilistic invariants**.

## Example:

- N = 440  # frequency A4  
- m = 2  
- k = 3  

**Splitting** → ["4", "40"]  

**Multiplying parts** → ["12", "120"]  
**Concatenating row-wise into a number** → PQ = "12120"  

### Comparison:

- PQ = 12120  
- N * k = 1320  

✅ Match at the beginning (`1`) and the end (`0`)

## Interpretation:

This resembles a **quantum collapse**, where **boundary conditions remain unchanged**, even though the internal state has transformed.
