# Large Number Analysis: Distances, Masses, Ages of Stars and Galaxies

## Example:

N = 13700000000  # Age of the Universe in years  
m = 2  
k = 1.07  # Time inflation or cosmic expansion coefficient  
splitting → `["137000", "00000"]`  
multiplying parts → `["146590", "00000"]`  
concatenating row-wise into a number → PQ = 14659000000  

### Comparison:

- PQ = 14659000000  
- N * k = 14659000000  
✅ Perfect match!

## Interpretation:

This result may serve as a model for the conservation of key parameters in cosmology:

- Leading and trailing digits may represent boundary conditions of the system  
- The coefficient `k` acts as an analog of the cosmological scale factor  
- The perfect match indicates structural preservation after transformation  

## How can this example be used in a scientific context?

### Model of Invariance in the Universe

- Initial and final digits remain unchanged under transformation  
- This may represent a model of conservation laws in cosmology  

### Analysis of Large Cosmic Numbers

SNS can be applied to:

- Distances to galaxies  
- Stellar masses  
- Ages of cosmic objects  
And used to identify invariant structures  

### Data Verification Method

- If the beginning and/or end match after transformation → data is consistent  
- If there is no match → there may be an error
