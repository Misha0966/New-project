# Genetic Sequence Analysis through Numerical Analogies

## Idea:

DNA can be encoded as numbers.

For example: A=1, T=2, G=3, C=4

## How it works:

**Encoding DNA as numbers**

| Nucleotide | Number |
|------------|--------|
| A          | 1      |
| T          | 2      |
| G          | 3      |
| C          | 4      |

Then use **SNS ( Structural Numerical Symmetry (СЧС))** to analyze structural conservation.

## Example:

N = 1342314234132  # Encoded DNA sequence  
m = 2  
k = 3  

Splitting → `["1342314", "234132"]`  
Multiplying parts → `["4026942", "702396"]`  
Concatenating row-wise into a number → `PQ = "4026942702396"`

Compare `PQ` and `N * k`:

- `PQ = 4026942702396`
- `N * k = 4026942702396`
- ✅ **Perfect match!**

This structural match after transformation indicates the conservation of key regions in the DNA sequence.

## Implications:

Regions of DNA that remain unchanged under scaling may be functional or invariant.

Such regions could be:

- Genes  
- Promoters  
- Terminators  
- Regulatory regions  

SNS could become a new method for identifying stable patterns in DNA.
