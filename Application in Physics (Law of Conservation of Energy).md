# Analogy Between SNS and the Law of Conservation of Energy

The **law of conservation of energy** states:

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed — it is conserved, although it may change form.

This is conceptually similar to how my **SNS algorithm** operates:

- The **beginning and end** of a number act like the **input and output** of energy  
- The **middle digits** represent internal transformation — like energy conversion within a system  
- A **match at the beginning and/or end** after transformation indicates invariance within boundaries

## Analogy Between SNS and Energy Conservation

| Element              | Physical Interpretation                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `N`                  | Initial energy of the system                                 |
| `k`                  | Scaling factor (e.g., acceleration, time, mass)              |
| `A₁, A₂, ..., Aₘ`    | Energy split into components (kinetic, potential, thermal...)|
| `B₁, B₂, ..., Bₘ`    | Energy transformation in each component                      |
| `PQ = B₁B₂...Bₘ`     | Total energy after internal transformation                   |
| `NK = N * k`         | Expected total energy after external influence               |
| Match at start/end → `PQ = NK`, structure preserved | Energy transformed, but key elements conserved |

## Example:

- `N = 899766`  # total energy in the system  
- `m = 2`       # two energy components  
- `k = 4`       # multiplier, e.g., acceleration factor  

**Splitting** → `["899", "766"]`  

**Multiplying parts** → `["3596", "3064"]`  
**Concatenating row-wise into a number** → `PQ = 35963064`  

**Comparison:**

- `NK = 899766 × 4 = 3599064`  
- `PQ = 35963064`  

✅ Match at the beginning (`3`) and the end (`4`)

---

## Interpretation:

Although the system was transformed (scaled by `k`), key identifiers — the beginning and end — remained unchanged.

This can be a model for **energy conservation in a system**, where:

- Internal values may change  
- But the **input and output of energy remain invariant**
