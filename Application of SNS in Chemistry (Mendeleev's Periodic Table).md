# SNS as a Tool for Analyzing Ordinal Numbers of Elements

## Example:

- N = 26  # Iron (Fe)  
- m = 2  
- k = 2  

**Splitting** → ["2", "6"]  

**Multiplying parts** → ["4", "12"]  
**Concatenating row-wise into a number** → PQ = "412"  

### Comparison:

- PQ = 412  
- N * k = 52  

✅ Only the end (`2`) matches

## Interpretation:

The end of the number often corresponds to the end of the atomic structure.  
This may be related to the electron shell, valence, group/subgroup of the element.
