# Application of SNS in Logistics

## Example: Route Analysis

- N = 105  # e.g., route A105  
- m = 2  
- k = 7  

**Splitting** → ["10", "5"]  

**Multiplying parts** → ["70", "35"]  
**Concatenating row-wise into a number** → PQ = "7035"  

### Comparison:

- PQ = "7035"  
- N * k = 735  

✅ Match at both the beginning (7) and the end (5)

## Interpretation:

The beginning of the number may symbolize the starting point.  
The end of the number — the destination.  
The middle — represents intermediate actions, changes in tactics or route.

If the beginning and end match, it means:

The cargo arrived at its intended destination, despite changes in the middle part of the route.

## Applications:

- Digital analysis of logistics data  
- Detection of route manipulations  
- Verification of data integrity  
- Analysis of key parameter preservation
