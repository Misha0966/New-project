# Application of SNS in Psychology:

## Model of Memory Function

- N = 12345  
- m = 3  
- k = 3  

**Splitting** → ["12", "34", "5"]  

**Multiplying parts** → ["36", "102", "15"]  
**Concatenating row-wise into a number** → PQ = "3610215"  

### Comparison:

- PQ = 3610215  
- N * k = 37035  

✅ Match at the beginning (`3`) and the end (`5`)

## Interpretation:

The beginning — entry into a situation (e.g., start of an action)  
The end — exit from a situation (e.g., result)  
The middle — internal state, emotions, thoughts
