# SNS Algorithm as a Tool for Solution Verification

My SNS algorithm allows partial prediction of the answer structure, making it a potential tool for problems in the NP class.

## Example:

- N = 123456789  
- m = 3  
- k = 7  

**Splitting** → ["123", "456", "789"]  

**Multiplying parts** → ["861", "3192", "5523"]  
**Concatenating row-wise into a number** → PQ = 86131925523  

### Comparison:

- PQ = 86131925523  
- N * k = 864197523  

✅ Match at the beginning (`8`) and the end (`3`)

## Interpretation:

- The beginning and end can be used as a solution certificate  
- Certificate verification takes O(1) time → fast verification  
- Finding the full solution may be computationally expensive, but verification is simple  

This suggests that my algorithm can serve as a model for problems in the NP class.

## Possible Definition of a New Complexity Class:

**SP (Symmetry Polynomial)** — problems where:

- The solution can be split into parts  
- Each part can be verified independently  
- Combining results gives an approximate structure  
- Matching the beginning and end provides sufficient confidence in correctness
```
