# Application of SNS to Special Relativity

## Example Using Einstein's Formula E = mc²

- N = 129  # m = 12, c² = 9  
- m = 2  
- k = 7  

**Splitting** → ["12", "9"]  

**Multiplying parts** → ["84", "63"]  
**Concatenating row-wise into a number** → PQ = 8463  

### Comparison:

- PQ = 8463  
- N * k = 129 × 7 = 903  

✅ Only the end (`3`) matches

## Interpretation:

- `12` — mass (m)  
- `9` — square of the speed of light (c²) → c = 3  
- `k = 7` — transformation coefficient  

A match at the end indicates the preservation of a key characteristic — in this case, the speed of light.
